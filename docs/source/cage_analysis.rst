Cage analsyis
=============

Here, we highlight useful analyses for `Cage` molecules, with some
internal pore. Many of these classes or methods have been applied in our
published works in slightly different forms, but generalised here. The
classes are not special, in that they can apply to any `stk.Molecule`,
like all other methods in :mod:`stko`.
